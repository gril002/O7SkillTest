# Employee management app
Simple app developed as an expertise test to demonstrate my Android development skill.

The home page displays all the registered employees and their name, gender, age and salary. New employees can be added by pressing the plus button, filling in the data and pressing Save. By pressing the Analytics button, you can see the average and median age of all employees, the highest salary and the male to female ration.

The app was tested on the Pixel 2 emulators API levels 24 and 28 and my Samsung Galaxy S10 API level 30.

# Instructions
- Clone this repo into Android studio
